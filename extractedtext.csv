This is totally disgusting ff I've ever read in my total life 😂😂😂
This is the reason why I left this fandom and I'm damn sure a 12 y/o army wrote this lmao
The out of context though… 8:33
I can't.... JK knows this guy too.... Can imagine JK searching up 'what is FF' XD
"Summary: Leaving his world behind, Jungkook journeys into the human world with the hope of making a fresh start. While he’s there, he comes across a human girl who he has gained an interest in."
"Warnings: switch!jungkook, switch!reader, explicit sexual content, inappropriate language, mentions of sex. Will add the rest of the warnings in the oneshot. "
"But once he crossed a pond, he gasped. At the edges, a couple of feet away from the pond, we’re some flowers. The flowers looked gloomy, their natural color was disappearing. It was getting dark, the steam slightly bending down as it awaited its final days. "
"synopsis. “tell me, sweetheart, what will your boyfriend say about me being here in the middle of the night?” or kim taehyung won’t let anyone else have you. you’ve been promised to him, after all."
"These were the things that had been promised to you by your parents, Taehyung didn’t doubt it one fucking bit. Nothing had been shown to you, nothing he could use, nothing to stimulate that pretty little mind of yours. You were a blank canvas."
"Taehyung wasn’t planning on getting married and staying married, especially to such an inexperienced girl such as yourself, fresh out of her private academy, and working under her daddy as a typist, a receptionist. At least not at first. Not until he met with you in person."
"a/n: first of all, this is pure filth - porn with no plot whatsoever. this was a result of raging hormones and DMs saying they want more jjk sexy fics. "
"summary: after being awaken by the thunderstorm, all you could think about is how jungkook fucked you so good a couple of hours earlier and now all you can think about is how you desperately want him inside you again "
genre: smut and no other; established relationship 
summary: jungkook is leaving for qatar but he wanted something before he leaves.
jungkook x reader (oc)genre: fluffword count: 1.3K
"p.s. Happy birthday, @holdinbacksecrets​! Here’s some dream boy for you. I love you so much, pal. I hope you enjoy! 🧡"
"The moment Jungkook walked into the bathroom and appeared in the mirror behind you, you sighed harshly and shot his reflection a glare. “What?” He asked, his eyes wide in confusion. "
"“You’re a menace,” you accused, ignoring how cute he looked with those damn doe eyes. "
"“Menace,” you again scolded, grabbing the liquid foundation as a giggle escaped his lips. Guiltily, Jungkook wrapped his arms around you from behind, nudging the side of your jaw with his nose. "
"“I’m sorry,” he smiled, peering up at you through the mirror. “In my defense-” "
Pairing: ex-bad boy! hockey player!jungkook x art major! female!reader
"Genre/au: comedy, drama, romance, friends to lovers, college!au, sports!au, hockey!au, fluff, hurt/comfort, slow burn, smut, angst. "
"Every interaction with Jungkook has been… interesting. No day ever becomes normal with Jungkook around. Ever since the first day they met, he just added chaos into her life. "
"synopsis. “oh angel, for how fucking adorable you are, you sure don’t use that pretty little brain of yours much,” or jungkook has no limits when it comes to you. you’re his, he’s gonna get it through your head, eventually."
You dared bring another fucking guy in his work place.
summary: you were so proud of your boyfriend leading his first mini solo concert so that's what you wanted to show him.
note: this is my first hoseok fic let's goooo~~ I also wanted to dedicate this fic to @sxtaep bc I know how much she likes hoseok *giggles* 
your body is on top of his while you softly kiss on his slightly red skin.
"“For a snow day tomorrow,” you clarified, earning an amused breathy chuckle from your boyfriend. “We could spend all day in bed.” "
"“Just like this?” Jimin asked, lifting his head to look at you. "
"“My fingers are crossed then,” he pressed a kiss to your shoulder. “Oh my god, did you hear my conversation earlier?” "
"Spring has sprung and engagement is on the forefront of all of Regency London's young ladies' minds. All except for yours, of course– the Queen's niece who a certain notorious author has named the Ton's most undesirable."
"A word of profanity left your painted lips as the outsoles of your lace-up boots danced across the limestone floor of the palace, making haste but not in a manner that was unbecoming, your head held high despite your mood running low."
"""Your highness."" One of the oldest guards snickered, his eyes flicking towards you knowingly as he and another guard moved to open the grand doors to their Queen's private quarters."
"Of course, the guards had already read the paper… Rotten gossips."
"Willing a smile onto your face, you were let into the room. Your aunt sat at her sofa, the furniture floral in design, its fabric dyed a luxurious red. Between her hands were the source of your dismay, the newest Lady Whistledown papers fresh off the press. "
"You hadn't had the pleasure of reading this week's issue personally, but word traveled outrageously fast in the palace; both maids and guards suckers for a good scandal. You knew quite intimately the matter of its content as you were the matter of its content."
"""Ah. Niece. There you are.” The Queen called you over, setting the paper down beside her unceremoniously."
"You walked closer stiffly, ""Aunt Charlotte, you wished to speak to me?"""
"What about a drabble where the oc hasn't seen jk in a while and when they are hanging out, she like finally sees him and smothers him with affection, kissing his moles and you know just giving him kisses and he's all giggly and blus.... Omg what have i done. "
The smell of cooking fills your nose and your mouth starts to water immediately. If Jungkook is unaware of the fact you’re home then you decide that you would keep this up and slowly tip toe into the kitchen in hopes to surprise your husband.
"You’d seen Jungkook’s bare torso more times than you could count on your fingers by now, but right here, right now, it was like the sun appearing from behind dark, grey clouds. Suddenly, your biology mock exam paper was almost forgotten as your pen tightened in your hand."
"“Okay, I can’t concentrate. It’s too hot in here,” You pushed your body up from the bed, swivelling your legs to set your feet on the carpet, “Lets go drive and get ice cream or something. I can’t work in these conditions,”"
"Jungkook’s lips dipped at the corners, but he did nothing to protest, standing as you swiped his shirt off the ground."

⤐ AU Type/Trope: Summer Nights Dream - Arranged Marriage AU
"⤐  Kink: begging, exhibitionism, clit spanking, blindfolding, delayed orgasm, overstimulation, light bondage, cum play, impreg. "
"Warnings/Tags: infidelity, grey-ish morals, horny but vanilla-sih, squirting, oral (f. receiving), slight degradation talk, 10 year gap (JK is in mid 30s), lowkey Yoonmin are a thing, lots of bickering, idiots in love tbh. "
"Summary: You don't ever seem to be able to stray too far away from each other. There's no way to backtrack once it's been set in motion, as long as you're both still breathing, you don't even think of leaving. What would people say if they were to listen through the walls?"
A/N: Happy JK day I guess. This piece is- something else. Hope you enjoy! See you in a few days with another fic! 
"Jungkook has proven to be a heavy sleeper, if the way you are able to roam around his whole penthouse was any indicator of that."
"The queen has made her list and checked it twice. She’s visiting those who have been naughty, and punishing them in ways that are oh so nice."
"Every weekend you pick up your niece so she can come over and play with his daughter. Poor girl hasn't had any friends over since her and her dad moved next door a year ago. Both girls are at yours today, and they fell asleep after playing in the backyard for hours."
"Sure you love spending time with your only niece, but the other reason you invite her to your place is to get to know her best friend’s dad."
"However, you never imagined you’d know him this well."
"⤖ genre: fluff, future smut, angst, gardener!jeongguk x rich!reader, okay but jeongguk isn't really a gardener like that but you'll see, kinda slow burn but not really "
summary - you want to recreate an iconic scene from the spiderman movie
"you sat cross-legged on the ceiling space almost directly above jungkook's head. you were fiddling with your camera, playing with the zoom and focus adjustments while jungkook crossed his arms below you."
"“don't tell me you’ve never wanted to do the spiderman kiss before,” you retaliated."
"jungkook rolled his eyes. “i never had any reason to, no.”"
"“jungkook, you don’t need reason for everything, relax.”"
"“i didn’t- I just don’t know why you need to take a picture,” jungkook said."
"“shh,” you interrupted, standing up. “you’ll thank me later.”"
"jungkook had to dodge your incoming skull by centimeters. your combined heights easily exceeded the height of your ceiling, causing jungkook's nose to bump into your jaw."
"you aimed for the tallest part of the apartment, and it barely allowed your lips to be on level plane. you focused on the camera for a few more moments before lifting it up and letting go, setting it up at the desk."
"you clapped your hands together in approval, then turned to face your boyfriend. “ready?”"
you sidled a bit closer while jungkook leaned in first but pulled back laughing.
"jungkook leaned forward again, and met your lips gently. the sensation on both ends was strangely unfamiliar; you were both well accustomed to the feeling of each other’s lips but being flipped threw everything off."
"“mm- did you take it yet?” jungkook mumbled against your mouth. his eyes were still shut, as he was waiting for the sound of the click."
“no- hang on-” you murmured in reply. jungkook could sense you reaching out to the camera with his mind.
"the camera clicked, catching the color risen to jungkook's cheeks and the giddy smile on yours."
"Summary: Taehyung loses himself in his imagination of the perfect night with you, where on a cold winter night at his apartment, you lose your virginity to him."
"The last, he’ll repeat to you in your ear as he doesn’t move, allowing you to adjust to the new fullness. His hands in yours, his face in the crook of your neck as he begins to thrust, rocking himself into you, feeling your legs wrap around him to take him in deeper. "
"Your deep breaths. Your moans. Your whimpers. Your whines. Losing yourself to him in the most intimate way. You’ll cum again, and he’ll hold you through it, until only moments later he’ll follow you. He’ll release into you, your body aching for his to fill you. "
Taehyung’s thoughts are broken by a sweet knock on the door followed by Yeontan’s happy barks. He smiles big as he opens the door to see your pretty face peeking out from underneath a scarf. Your nose red from the cold. 
"“You’re so cold honey.” He says, taking your hand and leading you in. “Welcome home. Come in, I’ll warm you up.” "
Fanfics where BTS are a pack or coven in an OT7 relationship really pull me in everytime. I’m so excited to write one of my own like that 🥹🥺
@ctlyt when i was in 6th grade i used to watch those hunter/harry ffs too on YouTube even though i did not know who they were 😭 and on wattpad i read bts fanfics 😭😭😭😭😭😭
@mosaichrts I thought skz also is a very ship centered fandom cuz i see those ao3 fanfics end of the year stats and its mostly bts and skz ships in the top lol
"I once saw the amazing bts impressions tiktoker say that yoongi writing fanfics was a mistranslation, he wrote scripts.What's the difference???Scripts shows that he really does love hard dialogue (all the communication) no faffing around with descriptions 🤭"

"@shooky0t7 Yeah, I write a lot!! It used to be World of Warcraft/Hunger Games/Star Wars/HP fanfiction, and now I've gone into BTS fanfics because it's my way of coping with them leaving until 2025."
@ccharza more fics ≠ better 🤦‍♂️just look at all the bts fanfics on there
"I forwarded @wannythefanboy 's ao3 to one of my irls who has no idea of BTS or kpop - or 3D people fanfics. She's only into 2D normally (Anime, games). She enjoys fanfic and agreed to ready recommendationsBoy oh boy, I LIVE for her reactions these days!!! It's amazing!! 🤣🤣🤣"
my friend would send me bts fanfics waaay before i started stanning bts and i thought yoongi was a bad boy and then I watched a funny bts video on YouTube and was like THATS THE BAD BOY???? WDYM https://t.co/Tr5r0wWDnS
"This does no mean that I don’t like BTS or Jinnie anymore no, I still love them just not to that extent anymore. I want to explore more fandoms and as you can see I have been retweeting other fandoms. I would still love to talk to people here but I just won’t be making fanfics—"
when joon started reading the fanfics on that bts story game LMFAO https://t.co/EdPD1wWhs6
