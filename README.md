I have trained and deployed a logisitic regression classifier in Python using a Tweets database without the use of any machine learning libraries.

The user can search terms/keywords in the GUI. The program uses APIs and scrapes text corresponding to those keywords from Youtube, Twitter and other sites.
Sentiment analysis is performed on the scraped text using the model I have trained. 
An overview of positive and negative sentiment on that search term/keyword is displayed in the GUI.
